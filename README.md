# ML Plant Health Classifier

## Overview

The Plant Health Classifier is a web-based application that uses a Javascript code snippet from Google Teachable Machine model to classify plant health. Users can capture images through their webcam determine if the plant is healthy, has rust, or has mildew.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration**: Capture real-time images from the webcam for classification.
- **Sample Images**: ( sample images to give the users an idea about the type of umages to be fed to the model.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow.js
- Teachable Machine
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser with a working webcam.
- An internet connection.

### Setup
Acess the the demo at (https://akbans.github.io/Plant-Health-Classifier/)
How to Use
Click the "Start Webcam" button to begin capturing images.
View real-time predictions for whether the plant is healthy, has rust, or has mildew.
Use sample images for additional classification.


Future Enhancements
Implement more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.
Add a feature to upload images instead of using webcam
click to test the model with sample images
Add a feature for real-time plant health monitoring.
